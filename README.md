ðŸ“Š Gisele's Data, AI, and Software Development Hub
ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Gisele!

Welcome to my GitHub profile, where I explore the intersection of data analysis, artificial intelligence, and software development.

ðŸ‘€ What I'm Focused On
I'm passionate about building data-driven solutions and exploring new technologies. Here, you'll find projects related to:

Data Analysis & Visualization: Turning raw data into actionable insights with Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

Artificial Intelligence: Implementing machine learning models, from classic algorithms to deep learning applications.

Software Development: Building robust and scalable applications using Python.

Large Language Models (LLM): I'm currently diving deep into the world of LLMs, learning how to leverage their power for various applications.

ðŸŒ± What I'm Learning
I am actively expanding my knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on their architecture, fine-tuning, and practical applications in real-world scenarios.
